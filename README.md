# Sparse_and_Balanced_MDS_Codes_over_Small_Fields
Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes with a sparse and balanced generator matrix are appealing  in distributed storage systems for balancing and minimizing the computational load. Such codes have been constructed via Reed-Solomon codes over large fields. In this paper, we focus on small fields. We prove that there exists an $[n,k]_q$ MDS code that has a sparse and balanced generator matrix for any $q\geq n-1$ provided that $n\leq 2k$,
 by designing several algorithms with complexity running in polynomial time in $k$ and $n$.  For the case $n>2k$, we give some constructions for $q=n=p^s$ and $k=p^em$ based on sumsets, when $e\leq s-2$ and $m\leq p-1$, or $e=s-1$ and $m<\frac{p}{2}$.
